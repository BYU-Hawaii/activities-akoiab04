        <p> I'm from <strong>Kiribati</strong>. My family are members of the church. I have 4 sibling and I'm the last.</p>
        <p> I went to Moroni High in Kiribati for 7 years.<em> I served my mission in the <strong>Marshall Island Kiribati Mission</strong>  in my hometown.</em>  </p> 
        <p> I came to <sub>BYUH</sub> in Spring 2022 and I'm in my junior year right now. Majoring in <mark>Information Technology</mark>, minoring in <mark>Pacfic Island Studies</mark> and <mark>Social-Work</mark>.</p>
        <p> I'm the only one in school right now, where my older brothers and sisters are done with school and start working. </p>
        <p> My favourite food is <i>Rice and Fish</i>. I love to sleep in my free time and I love hanging out with my friends as well. </p>

            <p> Quote from Church webesite </p> <br>
            <cite="https://www.thechurchnews.com/1996/9/21/23253293/moroni-high-school-an-educational-model/"></cite><br>
                More than 10 percent of the school's graduates go on to higher education. <br>
                Moroni High's strong vocational program also helps more than 60 percent of its 388 students find jobs before they graduate.<br> 
                It is extremely unusual in Kiribati - a country that empasizes academics - to find a school that provides vocationaly training.<br>
                The missionary couples help motivate the students. Their dedication is one factor in the school's success.<br>
                Moroni High is one of five schools in Tarawa, four are private schools sponsored by religious organizations, the fifth is a public school.<br>
                The LDS school covers Forms 1-6, which is equivalent to grades seven through 12. Classes are taught in English, the official language of the island nation.<br>
                All students are required to take religion, English, math, social studies and sciend classes. <br>
                The school also offers courses in office skills, computers, music, home economics, physical education and wood and metal shop.
