        <p>Few beach towns have it all, but Clearwater is one of those rare and precious jewels. Nestled on Florida's west coast near Tampa, the area averages 361 fabulous days of sunshine per year. And it even holds the record for consecutive sunny days at 768—that's more than two years of straight sun!

            It's no wonder why visitors from around the world (especially snow birds) flock to Clearwater to swim in—you guessed it—crystal clear water. A constant supply of warm weather (temps range from low 70s in the winter to low 90s in the summer) and close proximity to two airports (St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport and Tampa International Airport) make planning a vacation here a no-brainer.
            
            Main attractions include lots of free and family-friendly waterfront activities, fresh-from-the-Gulf seafood, great beach bars, an exciting year-round events calendar, a selection of hotels that fit any budget, and of course, miles and miles of drop-dead-gorgeous beaches.
        
            The most popular spot on the sand, Clearwater Beach, offers lots to do. Stroll the half-mile Beach Walk (pictured above), where you can spend a day frolicking in the water, checking out the surf shops, hunting for the perfect souvenir at a touristy boutique, or grabbing a bite to eat along the waterfront.

            No matter what you do during the daytime, head straight to Pier 60 for the nightly sunset celebration. It's a free show that you don't want to miss. Not only does the sun display brilliant, glorious colors across the sky, local street performers like fire-breathers, tightrope-walkers, and musically inclined jugglers will keep you oohing and aahing throughout the evening.
