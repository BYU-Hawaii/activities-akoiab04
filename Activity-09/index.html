        <p>Few beach towns have it all, but Clearwater is one of those rare and precious jewels. Nestled on Florida's west coast near Tampa, the area averages 361 fabulous days of sunshine per year. And it even holds the record for consecutive sunny days at 768—that's more than two years of straight sun!

            It's no wonder why visitors from around the world (especially snow birds) flock to Clearwater to swim in—you guessed it—crystal clear water. A constant supply of warm weather (temps range from low 70s in the winter to low 90s in the summer) and close proximity to two airports (St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport and Tampa International Airport) make planning a vacation here a no-brainer.
