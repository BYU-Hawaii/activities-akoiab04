                <p> The above picture is a traditional food in Kiribati. During culture days activity in different schools, students used to prepare this food for the celebration. 
                    They put it inside a weave basket from coconut leaves. It can be fruits, fish, coconut, and so forth. This traditional food are taken and found on the island. 
                    Every thing is fresh and that why they are called traditional food. 
                </p>
            <img src="images/Fish.jpg" alt="Traditional food">
                <p> I chose the above picture because fish is one of the main dish in Kiribati. Kiribati is rich different kind of fish because of the big ocean they have. 
                    Each day, people used to go fishing for their family meal. As for those who work, they used to buy fish from different fish market that they close too.
                    This picture was a fish market that's own by a family that used to fish everyday.
