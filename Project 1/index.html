        <p> Welcome to a PHOTO TOUR OF KIRIBATI. This photo tour will take you to some places in Kiribati that we want to take you to when you are planning to visit Kiribati.
            The above picture is the picture of our Flag that represent us. On the flag, you can see the fligatebird, sun, and the sea. A Frigatebird symbolises command over the sea, freedom and dance patterns.
            The blue and white wavy bands represent the Pacific Ocean. The sun rays represent all the islands of Kiribati including Phonexi and Land islands.
